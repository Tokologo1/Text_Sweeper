# Text Sweeper
#This project was inspired by the gab or rather the non-existance of a common social eco system, where all people gather in #a plartform that creates a space for every one to participate effectively and suffiecntly, without predudice. We are now in #the 4th industrial evolution and when the conversation is getting a smooth sweeter flow, the typing technique tends to get #exhausting. So i thought why not create a space where this function of recording yourself then the app converts the record #to text is fully explored. Now!! that is where Text-Sweeper gets in.


* [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started
* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* This template requires Node 14 to work. You can handle multiple node versions with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package-sample.json`. You just need to rename it to `package.json`, then run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
